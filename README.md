3D MODEL RENDERING OF TOWER OF HANOI
This is a report written for the department of electronic, communication and computer engineering, Pulchowk campus 
under the course of computer graphics. The major focus of the project is to learn the graphics programming tools by 
applying it to a real life project. Here we have used opengl (graphics API) library freeglut to implement tower of 
Hanoi by modeling 3d view of tower of Hanoi onto the screen and animating the movement view of the disk as the 
solution of the tower proceeds. 

Tools used:
    • visual studio IDE(2019 community edition), code blocks, with c++ language is used with GLUT libraries.
    • Compiler: GNU GCC compiler/c++ compiler
    • library file: OpenGL -GL.h, GLU.h, FreeGLUT.h

instructions for setup:
the code is mostly written in code::blocks IDE with C++ as the language of choice 
just download freeglut library as a dependency for the code file and include the dependecy to the code
then you can easily view, add, modify, udpate as per your suite
